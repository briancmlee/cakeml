The main parts of the artefact can be found in `unverified/async` directory, which contains the following:
- `PromisedCake.cml`: the CakeML source code containing the implementation of the concurrency framework, and supporting modules
- `basis_ffi.c`: the C FFI functions that have been added to support addition system calls from CakeML
I have separately attached the ./PromisedCake binary which was compiled with an updarted compiler.

Additionally, I have made added a new time library to the `basis` directory. I have attached the sexpr-bootstrapped compiler with this
new library separately. It should also be possible to rebuild the compiler on a different machine, producing the same result.
